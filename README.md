# Le Diplomate Tunisien: The React Native Mobile App
This website is launched by the Tunisian Association of Former Ambassadors and Consuls General (ATAACG) to serve as a liaison body with its members but also as a link between veterans of Tunisian diplomacy and their active colleagues. Its ambition is to be the vector of a real "Think-Tank" on strategic issues related to Tunisia's foreign policy as well as to serve as an electronic reference information body on national diplomatic issues.
